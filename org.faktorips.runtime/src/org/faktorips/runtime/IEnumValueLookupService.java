     * Returns an XmlAdapter that should be used for marshaling/unmarshaling data with JAXB for the
     * enumeration class this is a lookup service for. Returns <code>null</code> if it is not
     * required to use a special XmlAdapter instance. In most cases you return an XmlAdapter here if
     * the default mechanism provided by Faktor-IPS does not meet your requirements.
     * <p>
     * IMPORT NOTE: It is not enough to just return the XmlAdapter instance here, you also have to
     * specify the XmlAdapter class in the generated code! To understand this, you have to
     * understand how JAXB determines the XMLAdapter to use. For the exact details, please look at
     * the JAXB specification or tutorials.
     * <p>
     * Basically it works like this. If you have enabled the option to generate JAXB annotations,
     * Faktor-IPS generates a default XmlAdapter for each enumeration type that does not contain the
     * values. The adapter is required as for those types no Java Enum is generated, but a Java
     * class implementing the typesafe enumeration pattern. This generated class has an annotation
     * that specifies that the generated XmlAdapter should be used by default for all attributes
     * using the enumeration type as data type. For example given the enumeration PaymentMode,
     * Faktor-IPS generates the adapter PaymentModeXmlAdapter and the JAXB annotation in the class
     * PaymentMode would be @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(PaymentModeXmlAdapter.class)
     * <p>
     * The easiest option to use your own adapter is to change the tag @generated to @generated NOT
     * and change the annotation, for example to @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(MyPaymentModeXmlAdapter.class)
     * Why isn't this enough? It could be, it depends on your requirements. By default JAXB creates
     * an instance of your XmlAdapter class (MyPaymentModeXmlAdapter) by using the default
     * constructor. When unmarshalling the XML, you basically get the identifier stored in the XML
     * and have to return an instance of your enumeration class. In most cases you need the (this)
     * enum value lookup service to do so. The easiest thing to get a reference to this service is
     * by returning an XmlAdapter that has a reference to it, right here. If you create a new
     * {@link javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext} with {@link IRuntimeRepository#newJAXBContext()} the
     * adapter returned by this method is added to the {@link javax.xml.bind.Marshaller} and
     * {@link javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller} created by the <code>JAXBContext</code> via
     * {@link javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext#createMarshaller()} and
     * {@link javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext#createUnmarshaller()}
     * 
     * @see IRuntimeRepository#newJAXBContext()
     * @see javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext#createMarshaller()
     * @see javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext#createUnmarshaller()
     * @see javax.xml.bind.Marshaller#setAdapter(XmlAdapter)
