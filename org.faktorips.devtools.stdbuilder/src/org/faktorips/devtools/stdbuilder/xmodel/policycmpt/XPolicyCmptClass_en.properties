# {0} The unqualified name of the policy component type.
INTERFACE_JAVADOC=Published Interface for {0}.

# {0} Unqualified name of the published interface.
CLASS_JAVADOC=Implementation of {0}.

# {0} The unqualified name of the policy component type.
CLASS_NO_INTERFACE_JAVADOC=Implementation for {0}.

FIELD_PROPERTY_CHANGE_SUPPORT_JAVADOC=Helper object for Changelistener.

# {0} The unqualified policy component class name.
CONSTRUCTOR_JAVADOC=Creates a new {0}.

METHOD_INITIALIZE_JAVADOC=Initializes the object with the configured defaults.

METHOD_NEW_COPY_INTERNAL_JAVADOC=Internal copy method with a '{@link Map}' containing already copied instances. \n@param copyMap the map contains the copied instances
METHOD_COPY_PRODUCT_AND_GENERATION_JAVADOC=Copies the product component and product component generation from the other object.
METHOD_COPY_PROPERTIES_JAVADOC=This method sets all properties in the copy with the values of this object. If there are copied associated objects they are added to the copyMap in '{@link #newCopyInternal(Map)}'. \n@param copy The copy object \n@param copyMap a map containing copied associated objects
METHOD_COPY_ASSOCIATIONS_INTERNAL_JAVADOC=Internal method for setting copied associations. For copied targets, the associations have to be retargeted to the new copied instances. This method have to call '{@link #copyAssociationsInternal(IModelObject, Map)}' in other instances associated by composite. \n@param abstractCopy the copy of this policy component \n@param copyMap the map contains the copied instances

NOTHING_TO_DO=Nothing to do.

VALIDATE_DEPENDANTS_JAVADOC=Validates the object''s children.
VALIDATE_SELF_JAVADOC=Validates the object (but not its children). Returns <code>true</code> if this object should continue validating, <code>false</code> otherwise.
CREATE_VALIDATOR_JAVADOC=Creates the '{'@link {1}'}' for this {0} instance.
GET_VALIDATOR_JAVADOC=Returns the '{'@link {1}'}' for this {0} instance.

# {0} The unqualified policy component class name.
VALIDATOR_CLASS_JAVADOC=Handles validation for instances of {0}.
VALIDATOR_METHOD_VALIDATE_JAVADOC=Validates the {0}. Returns <code>true</code> if that object should continue validating, <code>false</code> otherwise.
DEPRECATED_VALIDATOR_CLASS_JAVADOC=@deprecated The generation of a separate validation class has been turned off. The methods in this class are therefore no longer called by code generated by Faktor-IPS. This class has not been deleted automatically to preserve manual calls and custom implementations.

METHOD_EFFECTIVE_FROM_HAS_CHANGED_JAVADOC=This method is called when the effective from date has changed, so that the reference to the product component generation can be cleared. If this policy component contains child components, this method will also clear the reference to their product component generations. \n<p>\n The product component generation is cleared if and only if there is a new effective from date. If '{@link #getEffectiveFromAsCalendar()}' returns <code>null</code> the product component generation is not reset, for example if this model object was removed from its parent. \n<p>\n Clients may change the behavior of resetting the product component by overwriting '{@link #resetProductCmptGenerationAfterEffectiveFromHasChanged()}' instead of this method.

METHOD_GET_EFFECTIVE_FROM_TODO_LINE1=TODO Implement access to effective from.
METHOD_GET_EFFECTIVE_FROM_TODO_LINE2=To avoid that the generator overwrites the implementation, 
METHOD_GET_EFFECTIVE_FROM_TODO_LINE3=you have to add NOT after @annotation in the Javadoc!

#Getter method for policy components in product components
# {0} The unqualified name of the policy component type.
METHOD_CREATE_POLICY_CMPT_JAVADOC=Creates a new {0} that is configured.

#Getter method for policy components in generations
METHOD_CREATE_POLICY_CMPT_IN_GEN_JAVADOC=Creates a new policy component that is configured by this product component generation. After creating the policy component it is automatically initialized. The new policy component is not added to any parent structure.

METHOD_RESET_PRODUCT_CMPT_JAVADOC=Clears the product component generation. \n<p>\n This method can be overwritten to affect the behavior in case of an effective-date change.

PRODUCTCONFIGURATION_FIELD_JAVADOC=References the current product configuration.

DEPRECATED_UNIFY_METHODS_JAVADOC=The setting for &quot;Unify Value Set Methods&quot; is &quot;Both&quot; and this method is generated with the old naming schema.

OVERRIDE_UNIFY_METHODS_JAVADOC=The setting for &quot;Unify Value Set Methods&quot; is different in the IPS projects of the class hierarchy. This method allows for consistent inheritance of the attribute.
