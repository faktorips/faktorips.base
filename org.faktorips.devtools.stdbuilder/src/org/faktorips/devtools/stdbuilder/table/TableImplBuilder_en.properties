TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_CLASS_JAVADOC = This class represents a read-only in memory table. Data can be accessed by the find-methods of this table.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_GET_ALL_ROWS_JAVADOC = Returns all rows of this table.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_GET_INSTANCE_JAVADOC = Returns an instance of this table class.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_KEY_CLASS_JAVADOC = Instances of this class are used as a hash key. The key specific map of this table representation is set up with instances of this class. 
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_KEY_CLASS_EQUALS_JAVADOC = Overrides the super class method and compares each instance variable for equality.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_KEY_CLASS_HASHCODE_JAVADOC = Overrides the super class method and creates a hash code based on the values of the instance variables.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_FIND_JAVADOC = Searches the content of this table for an entry that fits the specified parameters and returns the according row object. If no entry could be found, null is returned.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_FIND_RETURN_NULL_ROW_JAVADOC = Searches the content of this table for an entry that fits the specified parameters and returns the according row object. If no entry could be found, a 'null' row is returned.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_KEY_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR_JAVADOC = Creates a new key instance with the specified parameters
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_ADD_ROW_JAVADOC = Adds a new table row during the initialization phase.
TABLE_IMPL_BUILDER_INIT_KEY_MAPS_JAVADOC = Initializes the maps that are used by the finder methods of this table. This method is called during the initialization phase.
