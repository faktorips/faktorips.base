 * This interface describes that a source depends on a target. The dependency type describes the

 * {@link IIpsObject}s to indicate the dependency to other IpsObjects. The DependencyGraph which is
 * used by the IpsBuilder to determine the dependent IpsObjects during an incremental build cycle
 * utilizes the dependsOn() method to determine its state. It is up to the IpsBuilder how to
 * interpret this type.
 * <p>
 * Known implementations of this interface are {@link IpsObjectDependency} and
