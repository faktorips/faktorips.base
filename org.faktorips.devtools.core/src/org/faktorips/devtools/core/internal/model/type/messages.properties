Attribute_msg_DefaultNotParsable_UnknownDatatype=The default value {0} can't be parsed because the datatype is unkown\!
Attribute_msg_DefaultValueIsEmptyString="empty String"
Attribute_msg_ValueTypeMismatch=The default value {0} is not a {1}.
Attribute_msg_DefaultNotInValueset=The default value {0} is no member of the specified valueSet\!

Method_msg_NameEmpty=The name is empty\!
Method_msg_InvalidMethodname=Invalid method name.
Method_duplicateSignature=A method with the same signature has already been defined in this class.
Method_duplicateParamName=The parameter name {0} is used for several parameters.

Type_msg_MustOverrideAbstractMethod=Must override the abstract method {0} defined in {1}
Type_msg_MustImplementDerivedUnion=The type must either implement the derived union {0} defined in {1} or declared as abstract.\n(This rule can be disabled in the .ipsproject properties file via the \'derivedUnionIsImplementedRuleEnabled\' property.)

DuplicatePropertyNameValidator_msg=Duplicate property {0}. Note: Property names are compared case insensitive. Associations and attributes are both properties of a type.
Type_msgOtherTypeWithSameQNameInSameProject=There exists a {0} with the same qualified name within this project.
Type_msgOtherTypeWithSameQNameInDependentProject=There exists a {0} with the same qualified name in the project: {1}. In the ips object path of this project the entry for the project {1} is ahead of the source folder entry. It is recommended to adjust the ips object path.
