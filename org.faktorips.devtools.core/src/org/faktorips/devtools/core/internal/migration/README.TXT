Since Faktor-IPS 3.2 we have a new migration strategy!
The new migrations are stored in the package org.faktorips.devtools.core.internal.migrationextensions

THIS PACKAGE IS SET TO READONLY IN THE CVS

To avoid creation of old migration strategies we set this package to readonly in cvs.
If you have good reasons to provide changed to this package ask your administrator :)
