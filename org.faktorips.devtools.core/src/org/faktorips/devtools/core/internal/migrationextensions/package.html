This package provides the migration strategies for Faktor-IPS since version 3.2.
<p>
The new migration strategy does no longer needs any naming conventions for the classes. To find the migration
easily, it is best practice to name the migration <code>Migration_</code><i>[Version]</i>. There is also no need of
creating a migration strategy for every version! But the migrations still extends from <code>org.faktorips.devtools.core.model.versionmanager.AbstractIpsProjectMigrationOperation</code>
or even more precicely from <code>org.faktorips.devtools.core.internal.migration.DefaultMigration</code>.
<p>
If you need a migration strategy for a new Faktor-IPS version you have to create the migration strategy (best you do in this package) AND
you have to register the migration strategy by extending the extension point <code>org.faktorips.devtools.core.ipsMigrationOperation</code>.
In this extension you have to specify the migration strategy class next to the target version this strategy is responsible for.
This target version sould be the same as the migration strategy return by the method <code>getTargetVersion()</code>.
However it is not necessary to specify the exact version. As far the strategy is not responisble for a special qualifier version
you could specify the version number without the qualifier.
<p>
E.g. the Version strategy is resposible to migrate from version <code>3.1.x</code> to verion <code>3.3.0.rc1</code>: you do not need the qualifier rc1, target version is <code>3.3.0</code>.<br>
If you need a migration from <code>3.1.0(.rc1)</code> to <code>3.1.0.rfinal</code> (very bad practice!): you need the qualifier, target version is <code>3.1.0.rfinal</code>.<br>
Remember that qualifiers are arranged alphabetically.
