Migration_21_6_0_description=This migration updates each project's properties to match the new version 21.6.0. \n\
    Updates the IDs of Faktor-IPS features and classes configured in .project and .ipsproject. \n\
    For further information see the new and noteworthy: \n\
    https://www.faktorzehn.org/de/en/version-21-6 
Migration_21_6_0_IpsVersionTooOld=The previous version ''{0}'' of the project ''{1}'' is too old to be directly migrated to ''{2}''. Please update the project with Faktor-IPS at least 20.6 first.
Migration_21_12_0_description=This migration updates each project's properties to match the new version 21.12.0. \n\
    Faktor-IPS can now write schema information in all XML files and validate the files against those schemas. This is especially useful if files are sometimes manually edited in other IDEs. \n\
    This migration saves all files and adds schema information to the XML if the property 'validateIpsSchema' is set in the .ipsproject settings section. You can choose whether this migration should enable this setting. \n\
    For further information see the release notes: \n\
    https://www.faktorzehn.org/de/en/version-21-12
Migration_21_12_0_AddSchemas=Add schemas to XML files and enable validation
Migration_22_6_0_description=This migration updates each project's properties to match the new version 22.6.0. The setting 'associationsInFormulas' is removed as associations are always considered in formulas.\n\
    Faktor-IPS also has a new option for unifying the method names of value set methods. Instead of generating the type of the value set into the name like getRangeFor<Attribute> the new method of generating the names is unified to getSetOfAllowedValuesFor<Attribute>. \
    This migration rewrites all files if a different setting than 'ByValueSetType' is set in 'valueSetMethods' in the .ipsproject settings file. You can choose whether this migration should set a specific setting.\
    'Unified' will generate the unified names and delete the old methods, 'ByValueSetType' will not change anything, 'Both' will generate the new Methods and delegate to the old ones (in case of @generated NOT methods).\n\
    All UUIDs will be removed from the *.ips* files and category order is no longer recorded in ProductCmptPropertyReferences but using the 'categoryPosition' attribute.\n\
    For further information see the release notes: \n\

Migration_22_6_0_unifyValueSet=Preferred naming schema for value set methods, ByValueSetType is the traditional default:
Migration_Option_Unify_Value_Set_Description=Whether the value set methods should be unified for all ValueSet implementations, or as originally reflect their type in the method name. The three options are Unified, ByValueSetType or Both.\n\
    If the project uses a manifest, the generator settings are mirrored there and should be changed in the manifest as well when they are changed in the .ipsproject settings.
