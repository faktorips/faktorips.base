 * able to resolve the reverse question: which dependencies are targeted to a specific object.
 * <p>
 * The dependency graph is always responsible for the dependencies of exactly one project. More
 * precisely it is responsible for all dependencies which source object is in the responsible
 * project. Hence to get all dependencies for a specific object it does not satisfy to check the
 * dependency graph of the object's project. It is necessary to check also every project that
