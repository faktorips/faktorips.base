Faktor IPS is available under a dual licensing scheme whereby use of Faktor IPS in projects that are licensed 
so as to be compatible with AGPL Version 3 â€“ or in respect of a faktorips-runtime or faktorips-valuetype 
component with LGPL version 3 - may use Faktor IPS under the terms of the compatible license. Please see 
agpl-3.0.txt and lgpl-3.0.txt in the Faktor IPS package for more details. However, if this licensing is 
incompatible with your use of Faktor IPS, alternative license terms are available from Faktor Zehn GmbH.                    

In case you use Faktor IPS under the aforementioned terms, the following additional permission are stated: If 
you modify the Program (in respect to the defintion of the AGPL or LGPL), or any covered work, by linking or 
combining it with libraries of the namespace org.eclipse.* and org.junit (including dependencies or a modified 
version of these libraries), containing parts covered by the terms of Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (EPL), 
the licensors of this Program grant you additional permission to convey the resulting work.
