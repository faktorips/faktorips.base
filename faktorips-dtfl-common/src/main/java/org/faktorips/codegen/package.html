This package contains classes to generate Java sourcecode. The main concept
is the <code>JavaCodeFragment</code>. A Java code fragment is a text containing
Java sourcecode along with the <code>ImportDeclaration</code> needed to compile
the sourcecode. To construct complex Java code fragments with a uniform coding 
style you can use the <code>JavaCodeFragmentBuilder</code>.
