== Installing Add-ons

Faktor-IPS is very flexible and easy to enhance thanks to the Eclipse-plugin mechanism. Various add-ons are already available for a number of different activities.

In addition to developing your own, project-specific enhancements, you can use various helpful enhancements provided by Faktor Zehn (e.g. the https://www.faktorzehn.org/en/download/add-ons/#MultiEdit[MultiEdit Addon]).
