This package and it's subpackages contain the standard builders coming with FaktorIPS.
Sourcecode generation is always a tedious work and the resulting code quickly looks ugly.
We try to keep the code as clean as possible by following the conventions described below.

<h2>Naming conventions for builders</h2>
Builders are named according to the artefact they build / generate. If a builder generates a Java sourcefile
containing a published interface the builder is named XYZInterfaceBuilder, e.g. PolicyCmptInterfaceBuilder.
If the builder generates a Java sourcefile containing an implementation class the builder is named XYZImplClassBuilder.

<h2>Naming conventions for builder methods</h2>
getMethodNameXYZ		Returns the name of the generated method XYZ.
getFieldNameXYZ			Returns the name of the field/member var XYZ.
getParamNameXYZ         Returns the name of the parameter/argument used in a method signature.
generateMethodZYX		Generates the sourcecode for the method XYZ
generateSignatureXYZ	Generates the signature of the method XYZ without a trailing ;
generateCodeForABC		Generates all sourcecode related to the object ABC, generateCodeForAttribute
generateFieldXYZ		Generates the sourcecde for the field/member variable XYZ

<h2>Wiring builders</h2>
Often Java sourcecode generated by one builder references sourcecode generated by another builder. 
For example a class implementing a published interface has to use the same method names and parameter type or
a method implementation calls a method in a different class. To avoid redundant code we wire up the builders.
For example a builder generating an implementation class gets a reference to the builder generating the published
interface and uses the generateSignatureXYZ method to make sure, that name and parameters are the same for methods
that are implementations of the ones defined in the interface.

Naming conventions used:
implementationBuilder	In a builder that builds a published interface, this is the corresponding builder that builds the implementation.
interfaceBuilder		In a builder that builds an implementation class, this is the corresponding builder that builds the published interface.

<h2>Conventions for property files</h2>
Some aspects of the generated code are defined in language/locale dependant property files.
The text in these files should be accessed via the getLocalizedText() methods.
The language that is used for the generated code is defined per IpsProject. To easily access this
information the getLocalizedText() methods take an IIpsElement as a parameter. This element is used
to access the ips project. This is a conveniance as during code generation we always have one at hand.

<h3>Naming conventions for the keys</h3>
Keys start with the type of Java sourcecode element they belong to:
<ul>
<li>CLASS</li>
<li>INTERFACE</li>
<li>METHOD</li>
<li>CONSTRUCTOR</li>
<li>FIELD</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
The element prefix is followed by the name of the element which is followed by the type of the text.
We use the following text types:
<ul>
<li>JAVADOC - Text for Javadoc</li>
<li>ANNOTATION - Annotation without the @</li>
<li>NAME - The name for example a method to allows customizing the exact method name.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>CLASS_JAVADOC</li>
<li>CLASS_ANNOTATION</li>
<li>CONSTRUCTOR_JAVADOC</li>
<li>METHOD_CREATE_GENERATION_JAVADOC</li>
<li>METHOD_CREATE_GENERATION_ANNOTATION</li>
<li>METHOD_CREATE_GENERATION_NAME</li>
</ul>


<h2>API-Usage</h2>
Use the following naming convention classes:
JavaNamingConvention is available via getJavaNamingConvention(IIpsElement)
IChangesOverTimeNamingConvention is available via getChangesOverTimeNamingConvention(IIpsElement).
